Introduction

Deep learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) which uses artificial neural networks (ANN), a concept inspired from the structure and function of the human brain to learn. Learning can be supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised. Deep learning differs from other types of machine learning with large neural nets which are becoming increasingly accessible through technological advances in graphics cards and faster computer processing speeds. As such, Deep Learning has been out-performing older learning algorithms as they utilize scaling in both size of neural networks and size of training data resulting in their performance continuously increasing. 
Deep Learning is especially useful for image processing techniques, as the large scale of features involved in processing of images needs to be output and calculated with matrices, a technique which is aided by parallel processing used in deep learning.
